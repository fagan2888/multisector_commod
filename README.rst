Abstract
---------

This paper introduces a multisector model of commodity markets with storage,
where equilibrium is defined by profit maximization, arbitrage and market
clearing conditions. We then solve for the decentralized equilibrium via a
corresponding dynamic program.  We also describe the dynamics of the model,
establishing geometric ergodicity, a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit
Theorem.
